from Meaning, Logic and Ludics by Lecomte

If we don’t agree on some words or expressions, we have to justify ourselves,
and we cannot predict until what point we shall have to argue!
We therefore suggest replacing finite processes with potential infinite
ones, and therefore “proofs” “(potentially infinite) chains of justifications”.
This moreover involves a dialogical conception according to which dual
arguing processes are opposed to each other. My steps in arguing are precisely
determined by your steps in asking for justifications. This opens the
field to an interactive view of language. (292)

It is thus possible to characterize interaction in the following way:
Interaction is the coincidence of two dual loci in two different designs.
Like normalization in sequent calculus amounts to eliminating occurrences
of the cut rule, normalization here also will coincide with resolving a locus
with its dual. (324)

Then, orthogonality is defined via the notion of normalization,
thus revealing the importance of geometrical notions. Let us recall that in a
vector space, two subspaces are orthogonal if and only if their intersection is
simply the null subspace {0}, and of course {0} is self-orthogonal. In ludics,
this role must be played by a particular design: it is obviously the daimon.
Two paraproofs are orthogonals if their interaction leads to it, or in other
words, if there is a consensus: the game stops because the two players agree
to end it. It is also said that the normalization of the interaction between
the two objects is convergent. (324-325)
