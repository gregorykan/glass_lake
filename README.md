- intelligence is the capacity to compute
- a computation involves expanding and/or reducing possibilities
- a computation is always dialogical
- a computation is always an interaction (and vice-versa)
- the implicit goal of communication is coordination
- coordination relies on convergence/reduction

## example 1

- two people talking about how something works
- first person speculates that it works by any of [a, b, c]
- second person speculates that it works by any of [c, d, e]
- convergence is found on item c
- conclusion is c

## example 2: coordinating on finite resources

## example 3: coarse-graining / normalization to handle surveys of many individuals of high-entropy opinions

- "do we even converge on this coarse/abstract level? if no then we definitely won't converge on the more complex level?"


## example 4: are there lower-level convergences necessary for higher-level ones?
