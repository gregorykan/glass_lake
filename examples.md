# examples of application

## example 1 (well-behaved, complete reduction, i.e. convergent)

1. Speaker A: let us speak of your father and mother
2. Speaker B: my father is dead...
3. Speaker A: and your mother?
4. Speaker B: she is retired
5. Speaker A: I see

1a. A's question has an address (location), "1"
1b. it opens up two new addresses, "1.1" and "1.2", one for the father and the other for the mother (they are "negative locations" as they correspond to two different ways of continuing the conversation)
1c. B receives and accepts the question (records the location "1" as well as the sub-locations "1.1" and "1.2")
1d. A's question is a positive action
1e. B's recording of the question and its implications/ramifications is a negative action

2a. A has created two new locations, 1.1 and 1.2 and B has recorded both locations
2b. Therefore two reductions need to occur, regardless of order
2c. B responds to (focuses on) 1.1 ("my father"), a positive action, asserting the father's death
2d. A's negative action is to 'preview' or 'expect' such a response
2e. 1.1 has been successfully reduced, 'closed off'

3a. A's positive action involves implicitly accepting/recording/acknowledging B's response to 1.1, and reiterating 1.2
3b. B's negative action involves stopping further unpacking of 1.1, as B's asserting the father's death is a fact and non-negotiable (i.e. not open for further unpacking, argument, etc.)
3c. A's acknowledgement signals a successful reduction of 1.1 (and -1.1?)

4a. B's positive action is a shift of focus to 1.2, and an assertion on 1.2
4b. A's negative action involves a set of expectations which coincide with B's assertion

5a. A's positive action is to acknowledge B's previous positive action
5b. This acknowledgement reduces ('collapses') 1.2
5c. The interaction is complete


## example 2 (divergent interaction/disagreement/dispute)
